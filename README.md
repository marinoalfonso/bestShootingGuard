The great performances that Anthony Edwards is churning out this post-season with his Minnesota Timberwolves are there for all to see, so much so that some have even drawn parallels with big names like Michael Jordan. Taking inspiration from [\@jeff.loko_illustrations'](https://www.instagram.com/jeff.loko_illustrations/) graphic, I too wondered if Ant-Man is currently the best Shooting Guard in the league. To resolve this question, and to be true to the graphic, the performances of the players featured on the cover were evaluated, namely: Anthony Edwards, Devin Booker, Paul George, Jaylen Brown, Donovan Mitchell, and Kyrie Irving.
